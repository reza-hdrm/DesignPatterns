# Design Patterns for Java

## Why was this repository created?

For my own practice and to help other programmers I decided to implement several Design Patterns in Java. I hope
you like it and you will find it helpful. If you have any suggestions how can I write something better please create
pull request or message me

## What are design patterns?

The design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to
solve a general design problem in a particular context (Gang Of Four, 1994 ).

## Why to use them

Because they solve problems. You do not need to invent solution that is already working. How many times
during your programmer career you had this feeling that you already solved problem that you are facing now?
Same goes with patterns you have problem that could be solved using specific pattern. Keep in mind that you
should not force your code to fit in patterns. It should come out naturally.
