# Creational Patterns


## Intent
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code (Manage object creation).


## Implemented Creational Patterns
* [Singleton](singleton) - A class of which only a single instance can exist
* [Factory Method](factorymethod) - Define an interface for creating an object 
  but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
* [Abstract Factory](abstractfactory) - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* [Builder](builder) - Separates object construction from its representation
* [Prototype](prototype) - Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
