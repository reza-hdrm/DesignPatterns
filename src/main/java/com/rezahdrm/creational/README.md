# Creational 

## Intent

Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.


## Implemented Creational Patterns

* [Singleton](src/main/java/com/rezahdrm/creational/singleton) - One global instance of a class
* [Factory Method](src/main/java/com/rezahdrm/creational/factorymethod) - Define an interface for creating an object 
  but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate
* [Abstract Factory](src/main/java/com/rezahdrm/creational/abstractfactory) - Provides an interface for creating objects 
  in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
