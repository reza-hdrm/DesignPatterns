# Prototype

## Intent
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.


## Problem
Application "hard wires" the class of object to create in each "new" expression.


## Usage examples
* [java.lang.Object#clone()](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#clone--)
