# Iterator


## Intent
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).


## Problem
Need to "abstract" the traversal of wildly different data structures so that algorithms can be defined that are capable of interfacing with each transparently.


## Usage examples
* [java.util.Iterator](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html)
* [java.util.Enumeration](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Enumeration.html)
