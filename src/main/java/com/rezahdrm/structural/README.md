# Structural Patterns

## Intent

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient (Object Relationship (Aggregation and Composition) Management).

## Implemented Structural Patterns

* [Adapter](adapter) - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
* [Bridge](bridge) - Separates an object's interface from its implementation
* [Composite](composite) - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* [Decorator](decorator) - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
