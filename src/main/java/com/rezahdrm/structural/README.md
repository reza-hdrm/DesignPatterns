# Structural Patterns


## Intent
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient (Object Relationship (Aggregation and Composition) Management).


## Implemented Structural Patterns
* [Adapter](adapter) - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
* [Bridge](bridge) - Separates an object's interface from its implementation
* [Composite](composite) - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* [Decorator](decorator) - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* [Facade](facade) - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* [Flyweight](flyweight) - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* [Proxy](proxy) - An object representing another object
