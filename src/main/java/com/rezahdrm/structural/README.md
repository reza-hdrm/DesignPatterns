# Structural Patterns

## Intent

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures
flexible and efficient (Object Relationship (Aggregation and Composition) Management).

## Implemented Structural Patterns

* [Adapter](adapter) - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
* [Bridge](bridge) - Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
